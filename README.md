Currently supports only mmol/l. The skin retrieves the latest glucose value from the REST API every 5 seconds.

## Installation

Download newest release and use Rainmeter installer to install the skin. After the installation you need to modify the .ini file variables:

```bash
TOKEN =  <your-nightscout-user-token>
DOMAIN = <your-nighscout-server-address> e.g. my-nightscout.asdfg.com
```

Token can be generated by creating a Nightscout user. Only the "Readable" role is required for this skin to work.

Alternatively you can install the skin by manually copying the files to a directory of your liking and then loading it with Rainmeter.

## Plugins

This skin is using JsonParser 1.0 plugin https://github.com/e2e8/rainmeter-jsonparser/releases/tag/1.0 and it will be installed when using the Rainmeter installer.
